## Module

### Math Expression Evaluator

I used the [math expression evaluator's](https://www.npmjs.com/package/math-expression-evaluator) eval function to parse the calculations from a string into an understandable JS calculation, and this module made it possible to add more complex mathematical functions, such as trigonometry or pi.

## Shortcuts

- 'Enter' or '=' to calculate answer
- 'f' to completely clear the calculation bar, or the down arrow
- Left or right arrow to navigate through the calculation bar
- Up arrow to get the last calculated answer
- 's' to square
- 'i' or '^' to raise to the power
- 'r' to square root
